##Introduction

This study will attempt to replicate the findings of Experiment 3 in Biasing and debiasing health decisions with bar graphs: Costs and benefits of graph literacy by Yasmina Okan and colleagues (2018), linked below. This particular experiment was selected because the findings indicate that bar graphs increase the likelihood that participants will demonstrate within-the-bar bias while tables and dot plots do not induce this bias. Additionally, this study indicates that within-the-bar bias is more likely among individuals with higher graphical literacy compared to those with lower graphical literacy. My current area of research explores how K-12 students learn to reason with data representations and the findings of this study have implications for the ways that math and science instructors teach learners to interpret graphs. If individuals are more likely to demonstrate within-the-bar bias when interpreting bar graphs compared to tables or dot plots, further studies might examine whether or not particular instructional interventions can de-bias interpretations made using bar graphs.

To replicate the results of Okan et al. (2018), I will administer a Qualtrics survey using the same questions administered by the original authors. These questions are included in the supplemental materials of the paper along with the original source of the data used to create the graphs in each question so I can recreate these items exactly as administered in the original study. I will use the same three conditions (table, bar graph, and dot plots) outlined in the original experiment. In addition to these items, my survey will also include the graph literacy scale developed by Galesic and Garcia-Retamero (2011), which includes 13 items assessing graph skills (the scale can be found in Appendix A. of the referenced paper). Finally, I will include basic demographic questions as the authors of the original study did in their design. While all of the items are available publicly, I still plan to contact the original authors to ask for a copy of the exact survey administered because although the supplemental material includes all test items, it is missing the instructions each participant saw and I would like for this survey to be as close to the original as possible. Some challenges that I foresee with this study will be related to sample size. This experiment sampled over 600 participants on Mechanical Turk and I don't believe I will have the funding to replicate a study of this size.

##Methods

###Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

###Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

###Data Preparation

####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
